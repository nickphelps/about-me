<h2>Nick Phelps Overiview</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Nick Phelps. I'm 27 years old and live in Houston, Texas with my wife, Catherine, and my dog Callie. I graduated from Texas A & M Univerity with a degree in Industrial and System's Engineering and currently am the Regional manager for a small specitality construction company. My hobbies include golf, wake surfing, and Aggie football.
<h2>Programming Background</h2>
  <p>I was introduced to programming in college and at first glance I absolutely hated it. I got a 38 on my first VBA test and brushed programming off and thought it wasn't for me. Fast forward two years, I discovered Xcode and began building iOS apps and loved it. I learned to create basic iOS apps and now want to expand to web design. I look forward to learning web design in a structured environment so I can make my own apps and websites.</p>
